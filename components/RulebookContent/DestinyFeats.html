If you are wielding a weapon with more dex scaling than strength scaling, gain one AP worth of free movement for the first two turns of combat, and +2 acrobatics.' }

{ Name: 'Weapon Sculptor', Cost: 1, Description: 'You are a skilled machinist that can alter and hone weapons to better suit their wielder. Over the course of a long rest you may spend 4-5 days of hard work (2-3 days if you are a Grme, but still only once per long rest) near a magical bonfire/resting area to alter the scaling on one non-catalyst weapon and/or fully repair any of its durability loss, by using the magic of the bonfire/resting place. You may lower the weapons already existing physical or elemental scaling in a stat by one level (A to B, B to C etc.) and increase its physical or elemental scaling in a different stat by one level, up to a maximum of S scaling (adding/increasing strength or dexterity for physical scaling, or intelligence or faith for elemental scaling). Although, this can not add a new damage type to the weapon. If the stat scaling you are decreasing is at E, then it is removed. If the stat scaling that you are increasing does not already exist on that weapon, then it is increased to E. As well, adding a new stat scaling to a weapon which doesn’t already have a requirement for it, gives it a requirement of 10 in that stat. A weapon's scaling may have up to two alterations in this way, and an alteration from this feat can be reversed and removed through the same process. Weapons altered through this feat are more valuable and may sell for a greater price, and through your experience with them you have an easier time identifying and perceiving the quality of weapons. In addition to the other effects of this feat, while away from a bonfire/magical resting place, you may use your skills and whatever materials you have to apply a quick fix to a weapon wielded by yourself or a nearby ally. This quick fix costs 3 AP to do in combat and increases the weapons durability by 2d4, but allows the weapon to be more easily damaged again. As a result, the durability loss thresholds for negative effects on that weapon are lowered by two until its user gets it properly repaired (applies a non quick fix durability increasing effect to it). So for example, weapon scaling would be reduced/removed at 3 durability damage and weapons are broken at 8 durability damage, instead of 5 and 10 respectively. This negative effect can stack if you make multiple quick fixes on the same weapon before it is restored.' }

{ Name: 'Worthless Husk', Cost: -1, Description: 'All of your non knowledge skills are reduced by two. Gain one point of fate. (You can take this feat a maximum of twice).' }





{ Name: 'Deliberate Items', Cost: 1,

Although, if you take damage or are moved before the action resolves then it is interrupted. You must declare what you are consuming when the slow action is initiated, but you don’t have to decide how many charges/multiples of the item you are consuming until the action resolves.

This feat can only be taken when making a new character, or during a suitable moment in RP (up to GM’s discretion). Replace a missing arm or leg with a mechanical prosthetic made up of gears, rope, metal, and hard wood. The prosthetic limb bestows you with new abilities and enhancements based on if it is an arm or a leg. The limb can take durability damage and if a prosthetic limb would have normally been inflicted with limb fracture, it instead takes 1d6 durability damage. At 5 durability damage a prosthetic can no longer be used for its special tools and abilities, and at 10 durability damage it is permanently effected by the limb fracture condition until it is fully repaired.

\textbf{Status Hatchet} (x3 for 3 prosthetic tool points) $\rightarrow$ Small hatchets which can be thrown up to 20 feet toward a target space to deal (1d6 + D Str) physical damage and 2d4 bleed, frost, or poison status build up. The status type of each batch must be decided when this tool is equipped. Each status hatchet costs 3 AP as well as 1 FP to use.
\textbf{Overheat Charge} (x1 for 4 prosthetic tool points) $\rightarrow$ Build in a powerful cartridge which allows you to overheat the prosthetic and add damage to an attack. On your turn in combat you may expend the cartridge to add a bonus 1d20 damage to a weapon attack, with the weapon wielded by the prosthetic. This bonus damage is the same type as the majority damage of the attack. After the buffed attack, the arm can no longer be used to attack with any weapon or use any additional tools until the end of your next turn. This prosthetic tool may only be used before it is known if your attack hits.
\textbf{Concealed Weapon} (5 prosthetic tool points) $\rightarrow$ Choose any weapon which you can wield in one hand and engineer a contraption which allows it to fold in and out of your prosthetic. Allows you to spend 2 AP and 1 FP to draw the weapon into your hand or conceal it back into the arm. This does not take up one of your accessible equipment slots, but if the arm is destroyed with a concealed weapon then it cannot be retrieved until the arm is repaired. 
\textbf{Deflection Plate} (7 prosthetic tool points) $\rightarrow$ Allows you, once per round, to spend 3 FP to spring out a deflection plate and use the weapon skill Parry without needing to attune it or wield a weapon which has access to it. This tool is not effected by FP reductions to the usage of Parry itself.
\textbf{Auto Shield} (7 prosthetic tool points) $\rightarrow$ Spend 3 FP to unfurl a metallic umbrella shield from the prosthetic arm as a reaction, blocking an attack which threatens you from any direction. You may use this tool once per round before an attack hits you, in order to convert the attacks physical damage into poise damage as though you had blocked with a regular shield (including the AP loss from taking poise damage with the shield). Using this tool does not count as using a shield for the sake of feats, but causes you to no longer recover poise on the start of your next turn.
\underline{\textbf{Prosthetic Leg}}
Costs 2 points of fate. The prosthetic leg gives you +3 athletics, +3 acrobatics, and allows you to make enhanced jumps which increase your horizontal and vertical jump distances by 10 feet. For a cost of 3 FP on your turn, you may overcharge the leg to double your movement speed and increase your dodge distance by 5 feet until the start of your next turn. At the start of your following turn after overcharging your prosthetic leg, the leg goes into a cool down mode and causes all of your movement AP costs (including dodging) to be doubled until the start of your next turn.
   As well, you may expend a pure infusion stone (or any other method to infuse a weapon) to infuse the prosthetic leg and give yourself access to a special elemental stomp attack. An elemental stomp attack costs 3 AP and 2 FP and can only be done once per round. The attack sends an elemental cascade across the ground around you, hitting all adjacent grid spaces and dealing 2d6 elemental damage (of the same type as the infusion) to any grounded creatures that are hit, before pushing them five feet (one space) directly away from you.

\textbf{Toxicology: (cost 2)}
Through mastering a blend of chemistry and biology you may now expertly modify and craft poisonous material. Once during a long rest you may spend typically 2-3 days of hard work to create rot vials which behave similar to the rot paste item, but with an additional effect that triggers if poison build up is successfully dealt using the rot vial and then the creature becomes poisoned within the same turn. Alternatively, if the rot vial is fully drank/consumed and the consumer fails a DC (10 + Toxicology Point cost) Vitality check they become poisoned and suffer the additional effect (Non-humanoids with high poison resistance may have advantage or even immunity to this check). A creature will only suffer the effects of the last rot vial they were influenced by and cannot be under the effects of multiple rot vials.
The number of rot vials you can create over this time depends on your character level and the type of rot vial you are crafting. During each crafting session, you may use up to (1 + (level/4)) toxicology points to create rot vials. You may now also apply a rot paste or rot vial to a quiver of regular (non-elemental and non-status) ammunition or throwing knives to enhance your ranged attacks of that specific ammo type with the rot paste or rot vial for the item duration. The following is a list of the craftable rot vials and their effects:  
\begin{footnotesize}
 \begin{longtable}{ ||p{16.5cm}|| } 
 \myhline
\textbf{Vial of Veridical Rot} (1 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ small monster tongue):  While poisoned this creature cannot knowingly tell a lie. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Malignant Rot} (1 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ three charges of low quality strong drink):  While poisoned this creature cannot sprint and their jump distance is halved. Also, they have disadvantage on all skill checks made outside of combat. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Accursed Rot} (1 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ cursed root): While poisoned the creature does not lose HP from this poisoned status effect and may be completely unaware they are afflicted. The GM privately rolls 1d20, after a number of hours equal to the result has passed the creature suddenly takes true damage equal to 5\% of their maximum health multiplied by the number of rounds they had originally remained poisoned for. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Atrophic Rot} (1 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ rotten aged blessed mushroom): While poisoned the next 2 instances of healing are negated for the creature. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Virulent Rot} (1 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ poison gland): While poisoned this creature deals 1d2 poison status build up to all other creatures within 5 feet upon losing HP from the poisoned status effect. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Amaurotic Rot} (2 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ steaming hot tears): While poisoned this creature is under the effects of the impaired vision status condition. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Indolent Rot} (2 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ sleep pot): When poisoned this creature must make a DC 12 sanity or diplomacy check or fall unconscious and be knocked prone. While poisoned and unconscious the creature does not lose HP from this poisoned status effect and remains unconscious throughout the duration unless they take damage or are woken by a creature spending 3 AP to do so. Indolent rot vials are treated as sleep pot dust for the purposes of resistance from repeated exposure within 12 hours. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Fugue Rot} (2 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ numbing mist): While poisoned this creature must make a DC 12 Knowledge Magics or Knowledge World/History check in order to remember any attuned spell or weapon skill before they may use it. On a successful check that spell or skill will be remembered for the rest of the poison duration. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Paralytic Rot} (3 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ drain capsule): While poisoned this creature is under the effects of the locked up status condition. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Calamitous Rot} (3 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ poison dragon mold): For the first two rounds this poisoned status effect causes the creature to take 15\% of their maximum health as true damage instead of 5\%. This poisoned status condition for the creature has its duration lowered by 4 rounds. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Feral Rot} (4 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ pristine blood clot of a monstrosity and the eye of a madman): While poisoned this creature is under the effects of the berserk status condition (can no longer tell friend from foe). \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Terminal Rot} (4 toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ live insects of death): While poisoned the creature does not lose HP from this poisoned status effect, though a significant disease visibly spreads across their body. If the creature remains poisoned for a full ten rounds then a disease sets in afflicting them until cured. While diseased, the creature must make a DC 14 sanity check each night or be unable to gain a restful sleep for the purposes of exhaustion. This DC can be lowered by daily medical care by experts of disease or by someone with the Artisan of Physic feat of destiny. When a Multifarious rot vial combines Terminal rot it may persist (not including damaging effects) the other rot vial effects throughout the disease potentially leaving long term or permanent effects at the GM’s discretion. The method and difficulty of curing the disease depends on its effects and is also up to the GM’s discretion. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Ceaseless Rot} (X toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ poisonbite ring): This poisoned status condition for the creature is extended by a number of rounds equal to Xd8. When a Multifarious rot vial combines Ceaseless rot with Veridical, Malignant, or Indolent rot the effect persists by X hours after the poisoned status effect ends if the creature remained poisoned for a full ten rounds. \\ \hline
\textbf{Vial of Multifarious Rot} (X toxicology point) (requires $\rightarrow$ amalgamated flesh): You may combine multiple rot vial effects into a single multifarious rot vial by spending their total toxicology points cost + 1 and expending each of their required materials. \\ \hline

\textbf{Artisan of Physic: (cost 2)}
From studying the effect of a wide variety of curiosities and materials you have become adept at creating wonderous custom medicines. Over the course of a long rest you may spend typlically 4-5 days of hard work (2-3 days if you are a Grme, but still only once per long rest) near a magical bonfire/resting area to create a number of potions and medicines, by using the magic of the bonfire/resting place. Note that any potion or medicine you create through this feat counts as an item with appropriate AP cost to use in battle (based on Dexterity stat). The number of potions you can create over this time depends on your character level and the type of potion you are crafting. During each crafting session, every character level gives you one artisan point which you may spend to craft the following type of consumables:
\begin{footnotesize}
 \begin{longtable}{ ||p{16.5cm}|| } 
 \myhline
\underline{\textbf{Blood Extraction}}:  (1 artisan point each, up to a maximum of 3 per crafting session) $\rightarrow$ Extract and process your own blood to be used in a pinch. Roll a d2, if the result is a 2 then successfully process the blood and create a blood vial item. If the result is a 1 then the blood congeals and separates creating a crimson water. See the items list for details on the blood vial and crimson water items. \\
 \myhline
\underline{\textbf{Material Potions}}: (2 artisan points each) $\rightarrow$ Brew a mix of a drop of your own blood, and materials such as plants and monster parts to create a drink or consumable with a useful effect. Does not cost many artisan points, but each one requires specific separate materials which must be collected.
A list of material potions and their ingredients:   \\\nobreakhline
\textbf{Minor potion of frost resistance} (requires $\rightarrow$ bellowing snowbloom, or rime blue moss bulb): Drink to gain +3 frost status resistance for next four hours. \\ \hline
\textbf{Potion of frost resistance} (requires $\rightarrow$ frost resistant monster flesh): Drink to gain +6 frost status resistance for next four hours. \\ \hline
\textbf{Cream of frost cure} (requires $\rightarrow$ great tree root resin, pristine ice, and potent herbs): Apply to wounds when poisoned to cure the poisoned status effect but take 1d4 frost build up. The first time this is used to cure a creatures poison, that creature gains a permanent +2 frost resistance. \\ \hline
\textbf{Minor potion of blood clotting} (requires $\rightarrow$ monster blood clot, or bloodred moss bulb): Drink to gain +3 bleed status resistance for the next four hours. \\ \hline
\textbf{Potion of blood clotting} (requires $\rightarrow$ unclotted and cold beast blood): Drink to gain +6 bleed status resistance for the next four hours. \\ \hline
\textbf{Cream of blood warmth} (requires $\rightarrow$ great tree root resin, razor tulip, and potent herbs): Apply to wounds when frostbitten to cure the frostbitten status effect but take 1d4 bleed build up. The first time this is used to cure a creatures frostbite, that creature gains a permanent +2 bleed resistance. \\ \hline
\textbf{Minor potion of elemental resistance} (requires $\rightarrow$ colourful flowers and dense coal (fire), or crystal residue (magic), or gold flower (lightning), or dried sane human flesh (dark)): Drink to increase elemental damage resistance by one tier for four hours. The elemental resistance gained corresponds to the element of the potion that was brewed. \\ \hline
\textbf{Potion of elemental resistance} (requires $\rightarrow$ colourful flowers and mantle coal (fire), or white blood (magic), or fulgur steel (lightning), or living human bone powder (dark)): Drink to increase elemental damage resistance by two tiers for four hours. The elemental resistance gained corresponds to the element of the potion that was brewed. \\ \hline
\textbf{Balm of embetterment} (requires $\rightarrow$ dense coal, gold, and the most pristine organ of a fast monster (Endurance), or wise monster (Faith), or intelligent monster (Intelligence), or strong monster (Strength), or dextrous monster (Dexterity), or focused monster (Attunement)): Apply the warm balm to your skin to increase a stat by one for the next hour. The increased stat depends on the pristine organ ingredient used in brewing. \\ \hline
\textbf{Companion restoration potion} (requires $\rightarrow$ mercury residue and a blessed mushroom): Drink to revive a magical companion (as per the Companion feat of destiny) which was destroyed when within 60 feet of you. The companion is restored to half HP and FP, and appears in an unoccupied space next to you, or in your space if it is your own turn and they can move out of the space on their own. \\ \hline
\textbf{Custom rejuvenation potion} (requires $\rightarrow$ dried herbs, a blessed mushroom, and a prism stone): Upon creation of this potion, allocate ten points into either HP or FP regeneration. When this potion is drank it restores the allocated amount of HP and FP. \\ \hline
\textbf{Potion of translucence} (requires $\rightarrow$ mercury residue, crystal residue, and a silken cloth): Drink to gain the non charged effects of the Hidden Body spell on yourself. \\ \hline
\textbf{Broth of ephemeral tongues} (requires $\rightarrow$ mercury residue and a living humans tongue): Consume the thick broth to gain the ability to fluently speak the racial language of the person whos tongue was used in brewing (Grme, Fernian, Corvian, Draconic, Demonic, Darrish, Abyssal (Locust speak), Deep speak (Elden), Lethrellian (Vileblood/Ancient)). This effect lasts for four hours after consumption. \\ \hline
\textbf{Green bulb tea} (requires $\rightarrow$ greenblossom bulb (x4), or blooming greenblossom bulb (x2)): A very pleasant tea which revitalizes the body. Drink to increase the AP of your next two turns in combat by 3. This effect does not stack with itself or that of raw greenblossom or blooming greenblossom bulbs. \\ \hline
\textbf{Purple bulb tea} (requires $\rightarrow$ purple moss bulb (x3) and a blooming purple moss bulb): A strong and pungent tea which strengthens the bodies response to poisons. Drink to cure both poisoned and badly poisoned statuses, and the first time it is used to cure them, permanently increase your status threshold for poison and toxic by +2 (for curing poisoned and badly poisoned statuses respectively). \\
\myhline
\underline{\textbf{Incense Jars}}: (3 artisan points each) $\rightarrow$ A strange mix of expanding gasses and particles which can often be sprayed over an area of multiple grid spaces. These medicines can give buffs to yourself and multiple allies, but often come with negative side effects. Does not require any external materials for creation. Ten days after they are made, incense jars lose their potency and effects, becoming a pale vapour with little to no value.
A list of incense jars and their effects:   \\\nobreakhline
\textbf{Sizzling Bubbles}: Toss the jar of fumes into the air around you to coat yourself and up to two willing allies of your choice, within 15 feet of yourself, with sizzling sparks of repelling force. All affected creatures gain three tiers of physical resistance, but also the impaired vision status condition, until the start of your following turn. \\ \hline
\textbf{Bloodrage Aroma}: Spray blood red fumes in a cone reaching up to 15 feet in front of yourself, or directly into your own face. You, or any willing allies within the area you sprayed, may breath deep of the fumes to enrage themselves until the start of your next turn. Each enraged creature may add two d20 damage die to any two attacks they make (with the damage type being the same as the majority damage of the attack), but they are also inflicted by the berserk status condition forcing them to no longer make the distinction between friend or foe over the same period of time. \\ \hline
\textbf{Petrification Perfume}: Pop open this jar of incense to allow yourself and one willing ally within 5 feet of you to breath deep of its fumes. You both become inflicted with the staggered status condition, but are also immune to any non true damage until the condition clears. In this state you are frozen in position and cannot resist any hostile effects or forced movements. \\ \hline
\textbf{Clinging Bell Fume}: Toss the jar of metallic particles into the air around you to coat yourself and up to three willing allies of your choice, within 15 feet of yourself, with small vibrating strands or metal. All affected creatures are inflicted with the deafened status condition by the vibrations, but gain the ability to easily cling to and climb any surface (for regular AP cost of movement), until the start of your following turn. \\ \hline
\textbf{Flowered Spice}: A wonderfully scented incense which is a pleasure to imbibe. Any creature exposed to this scent gains a heightened sense of focus, but also a dependence on the substance for a short time. Use on yourself, a willing ally, or a restrained creature which cannot hold its breath for long, to give them +1 FP regeneration on the start of their turns in combat and +5 to perception and precision for ten minutes. When this effect subsides the creature must use another dosage of this incense within the next hour or gain a point of exhaustion. \\ \hline
\textbf{Incense of Rebirth}: Toss these crystalline fumes over a small area during a bonfire/magical short rest to allow up to two willing and adjacent creatures to raise one stat of their choice, and lower another. This incense jar will only effect a creature the first time it is used on them, and gives them a permanent paler and more sickly complexion. \\ \hline
\textbf{Chaotic Rejuvenation Mists}: Spray the jar of mist into the air around you to coat up to three willing creatures of your choice, within 10 feet of you, in a rainbow dew. Each affected creature affected must roll (2d10 - 8). If the result is positive then they may distribute the number into HP and FP regeneration as they see fit. If the result is negative then they must take its magnitude in true damage or FP loss as they see fit. If the result is zero then they may permanently increase their maximum HP by two (up to a maximum possible +6 max HP from this incense jar). \\ \hline
\textbf{Chaotic Status Mists}: Spray the jar of mist into the air around you to coat up to three willing creatures of your choice, within 10 feet of you, in a prismatic dew of a specific (non-poise) status effect which was chosen upon the creation of this incense jar. Each affected creature must roll (2d8 - 7). If the result is positive then they may reduce their build up of the status effect by the same amount. If the result is negative then they must take its magnitude in status build up of the specified status effect. If the result is zero then they may permanently increase their maximum status threshold for that status effect by one (up to a maximum possible +3 max status threshold per status from this incense jar). \\ \hline
\textbf{Mimic's Veiled Fog}: Spray the jar of vapours into the air around you to coat up to three willing creatures of your choice, within 10 feet of you, in an ever changing fog. Each creature affected gains the non charged effects of the sorcery spell Powdered Light, but for only twelve seconds (two rounds of combat). When the duration elapses all effected creatures are inflicted with the dazed status condition for six seconds (one round in combat). \\ \hline
\textbf{Ignition Powder}: Spray a sparking powder in a cone reaching up to 15 feet in front of yourself, which then ignites and burns as an item based attack. All creatures which are hit by the burning powder take (2d4 + D Str, D Dex) fire damage, and 1d2 durability loss to their equipped armor or innate physical protection. \\ \hline
\textbf{Jagged Crystal Powder}: Spray a mist of jagged crystalline powder in a cone reaching up to 15 feet in front of yourself, which crackles and cuts the area as an item based attack. All creatures which are hit by the crystal powder take (2d4 + D Str, D Dex) magic damage, and 1d2 bleed build up. \\ \hline
\textbf{Heavy Powder}: Spray a fog of heavy gravitational powder in a cone reaching up to 15 feet in front of yourself, which falls and causes the earth to spike up from the area as an item based attack. All grounded creatures which are hit by the spiked earth take (2d4 + D Str, D Dex) physical damage. After the attack is resolved, the area of spiked earth becomes difficult terrain as the spikes crumble. \\
\myhline
\underline{\textbf{Wonderous Concoctions}}: (5 artisan points each) $\rightarrow$ An expertly mixed concoction providing custom effects when drank. \textbf{Each one is a mix of two beneficial properties of your choosing}. Does not require any external materials for creation, but a creature may not experience the effects of a second wonderous concoction until they finish their next bonfire/magical long rest. Ten days after they are made, all wonderous concoctions will dilute, causing them to lose their effects and become an oily liquid with little to no value.
Choose up to two of any of these effects when creating a wonderous concoction:   \\\nobreakhline
- Set all damage resistances to 90\% reduction, until after the next instance of damage you take, or until one minute has elapsed (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- The next instance of elemental damage you take, of an element of choice, instead heals you for the amount of damage you would have taken (not including any damage resistances you may have had, and with the choice of element being made upon brewing the concoction). \\ \hline
- Gain the ability to cast spells for no FP cost until the start of your next turn after drinking (about 6 seconds). Although, any AP cost reduction to casting these spells does not apply while this effect is active. \\ \hline
- Increase your innate speed, allowing you to immediately start a sprint while retaining the ability to make any other action until the end of your turn. \\ \hline
- Increase your maximum HP by 20\% (but do not heal for that amount). This effect is prioritized to take place before any other effect of the concoction, and lasts for one minute (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- Heal for 50\% of your maximum HP. \\ \hline
- Increase your maximum FP by 25\% (but do not replenish it for that amount). This effect is prioritized to take place before any other effect of the concoction, and lasts for one minute (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- Regenerate 50\% of your maximum FP. \\ \hline
- Increase your maximum AP by one, for one minute (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- Increase your maximum poise threshold by 2, for one minute (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- Swap your status effect thresholds for two status effects (not including poise). This effect lasts for one minute (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- Heal 1 HP for every point of status build up you reduce on yourself (including over time reduction of build up). This effect lasts for one minute (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- Reduce your status build up for a chosen non poise status to zero (with the choice of status made upon brewing the concoction). \\ \hline
- Every attack you make until the start of your next turn (after resolving any slow actions), deals a bonus +1 damage which increases by 1 for each attack you make. \\ \hline
- The next heavy attack you make deals +2 poise damage. This effect dissipates after one minute (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- If you die from having your HP reduced to 0, until the end of your next turn, you may add +3 to your undying check. \\ \hline
- The next skill check you make to resist an adverse effect in combat, automatically succeeds. This effect dissipates after one minute (ten rounds of combat). \\ \hline
- Explode, dealing 2d10 fire damage to all grid spaces within 10 feet of yourself, but deal the same amount in true damage to yourself. This effect is prioritized to take place after any other effect of the concoction. \\
