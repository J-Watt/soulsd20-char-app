They can move away from you to any range, but if they are killed outside of a 60 foot range of you then they will not re spawn until your next long rest, instead of your next short rest.

Your companion is immune to status effects, and their skills are all zero with two non-knowledge skills of your choice starting at +2. At character level 9 you may increase those two skills to +4 and choose two more non-knowledge skills to be +2. At character level 19 you may increase the +4 skills to +6. Your companion may have one special ability that they can use a maximum of once per round on your turn, costing 1 FP. This ability can either give one medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of them the impaired vision status condition for one round, heal an ally for 1d4 + (your Att mod/2) HP at a range of 60 feet, or add 1d2 status damage to all of their attacks for the round (status of your choice excluding curse, toxic, and poise damage).

Once you have made a prediction you must complete a short rest before you make a prediction about that same creature. All clairvoyance stacks expire upon completing a short rest. You now have the choice to make a perfect dodge as a reaction to an attack instead of a basic dodge action by expending a stack of clairvoyance. When performing a perfect dodge, choose a valid location within range of your current dodge distance, if the chosen location is not targeted by the attack you avoid all incoming damage of the attack and may chose your final location to be either the chosen location or your starting location. If a perfect dodge succeeds then its AP cost is 0.
